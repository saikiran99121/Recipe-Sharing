                <h3>This is the recipe details.</h3>
                Note: In the step-by-step directions shown here, I am showing the ingredient measurements for 1 serving
                of chia pudding. In the recipe card below, the measurements are for 2 servings. You can easily scale the
                recipe up or down as according to your needs. <br>
                1. Add 2 tablespoons of chia seeds to a glass or jar. If you want you can rinse the seeds with water in
                a superfine strainer first. <br>
                2. Add ¾ cup light coconut milk or the liquid of your choice. For a less thick pudding, add 1 to 1.25
                cups light coconut milk. <br>
                3. Sweeten with 2 tablespoons coconut sugar. <br>
                4. Sprinkle with 2 pinches of ground cardamom or ground cinnamon. You can even flavor with ⅛ teaspoon
                vanilla extract. <br>
                5. Mix everything till the coconut sugar is dissolved. Break up any lumps with a spoon. Cover the
                glasses and place them in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours, or overnight. <br>
                6. Later, remove the glasses from the fridge. You will see that the pudding has nicely thickened. <br>
                7. Stir again and break up any lumps. The pudding will be thick. <br>
                8. Top chia pudding with your desired toppings like chopped fruits and nuts, then serve. Most of the
                time I add bananas (as they are a staple in my home), strawberries (when in season), and blueberries.

                During mango season, I love to have mangoes in my chia seed pudding. For the nuts, I add whatever I have
                in the kitchen — almonds, raisins, cashews, pistachios, pine nuts, walnuts, etc. Serve straight away.

                Drying the meat
The day before you want to serve the pork, begin by drying the joint. Unwrap, pat dry with kitchen paper and place on a plate. Transfer to the fridge overnight, lightly covered with kitchen paper.

A dry rind is essential for crispy crackling. If your joint has been wrapped in plastic, it may have ‘sweated’ a little, so it’s important to remove as much of this moisture as possible to give it the best start. <br>
INGRIDIENT <br>

750g pork belly joint
⅛ tsp Szechuan peppercorns
⅛ tsp fennel seeds
⅛ tsp Chinese five-spice
1 cardamom pod, seeds removed
1 tbsp fine salt, plus 1 tsp
charred pak choi and roast potatoes, to serve (optional)

Serves 4 | Takes 1 hr 40 mins plus resting and overnight chilling

Freezing and defrosting guidelines

Freeze without crackling. In order to enjoy optimum flavour and quality, frozen items are best used within 3 months of their freezing date. For more tips on freezing and defrosting food, read our article Love Your Freezer.

                <h3>This is the recipe details.</h3>
                Kneading the dough
Stir the sugar into 400ml warm water until dissolved. Put the flour, yeast and salt in a mixing bowl, make a well in the centre, then pour in the sugared water. Mix with the dough hook attachment of an electric whisk on a low-medium speed for 10 mins until smooth. If making by hand, knead for 25 mins until smooth and pliable.
Bagel dough needs to be kneaded for longer than other breads to build the gluten and make them chewy. It’s a very stiff dough, so it’s easier to use a mixer if you have one. You can do it by hand, it just requires extra work. When ready, the dough will be smooth and tight.

Kneading the dough
Removing air bubbles
Lightly grease a large bowl with oil, add the dough and lightly cover with clingfilm or a damp tea towel. Leave to rise at room temperature for 1 hr or until doubled in size.

Knocking back the dough gets rid of large air bubbles, giving the finished bagels a more even texture. Push the dough down with your hand and knead briefly on a worktop until smooth and soft.
Boiling the bagels seals the crust so they won’t break in the oven. Adding bicarbonate of soda to the water breaks down the starch, and gives the bagels their signature chewy, shiny crust. <br>

2 tbsp soft dark brown sugar
800g strong white bread flour
7g fast-action dried yeast
2 tsp table salt

1 medium egg white, lightly beaten
3 tbsp poppy seeds or sesame seeds (optional)

                Making the cuts
                Using a sharp knife, make diagonal cuts in the flesh on each side, about  1.5cm (3/4in) deep.
                
                Making the cuts
                Stuff for flavour
                Put a few slices of lemon (halved if necessary) and sprigs of herbs in the cavity of each fish – thyme, rosemary, dill and parsley all work well. 
                
                Stuff for flavour
                Oil the fish
                Rub the skin all over with oil.
                
                Oil the fish 
                Cooking time
                Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the fish. Sardines will cook in about 5 minutes, fish weighing about 500g will take 15-20 minutes and fish weighing about 1kg will take 20-30 minutes. Cook the fish on indirect heat for half the cooking time until the skin crisps. Turn it over and cook for the rest of the time or until the fish flakes easily. 
                
                Cooking time
                Serve and garnish
                Serve with more lemon slices for squeezing and some extra chopped herbs.

                Grease the ramekins
                Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Use a little softened butter to grease 4 x 9cm ceramic ramekins until thoroughly coated. Sprinkle over 2 tbsp Parmesan so the insides of the ramekins are coated, tipping away any excess.
                
                Grease the ramekins
                Make the base
                Heat 40g unsalted butter in a pan over a medium heat until melted, then stir in 40g plain flour and mix until smooth. Gradually stir in 300ml whole milk. Cook, whisking continuously, for 5 mins or until the mixture thickens.
                
                Make the base
                Add the cheese
                Then remove from the heat and add 100g coarsely grated Gruyère cheese. Stir until melted then transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Leave to cool for 5 mins. Separate 4 eggs, reserving the whites. Stir the yolks into the cooled cheese mixture, one at a time, until well incorporated. Cover and leave to cool to room temperature.
                
                Add the cheese
                Whisk the egg whites
                Place the reserved egg whites in a clean bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form. Stir a heaped tablespoonful into the cheese base until loosened and well incorporated. Carefully stir through the remaining whites using a large metal spoon, trying to only stir once or twice, taking care to knock out as little air as possible.
                
                Whisk the egg whites
                Top hatting
                Place the prepared ramekins on a baking sheet and divide the soufflé mixture between them. Run a cutlery knife or your finger around the edge of each ramekin to create a ‘top hat’ effect. This will ensure the soufflés rise evenly. Scatter 1 tbsp finely grated Parmesan over the tops.
                
                Top hatting
                Bake in the oven
                Bake the soufflés for 13-15 mins until the soufflés are well risen. The tops should feel soft but springy to touch and will wobble slightly when the ramekin is tapped.
                
                Bake in the oven
                Serve the soufflés
                Soufflés will remain firm and risen for just a few minutes before they start deflating, so serve and eat immediately after removing from the oven. <br>

                <h3>This is the recipe details.</h3>
                Prepare the filling
Break up 200g white chocolate and put in a heatproof bowl. Pour 100ml double cream into a small pan and bring just to the boil over a medium heat. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave for 5 mins before adding a little pink food colour gel and stirring to form a bright pink, silky-smooth ganache. Leave to cool completely, then chill, covered, until of a piping consistency.

Blitz the macaron mixture
Meanwhile, line 3 large baking sheets with nonstick baking paper. Blitz 150g ground almonds and 175g icing sugar in a blender or a food processor until fine. This step is essential as lumps in the mixture will flatten the batter and can cause the macarons to have a bumpy surface.

Blitz the macaron mixture
Whisk the whites
With an electric whisk, beat 3 large egg whites (at room temperature) until soft peaks form. Make sure the bowl you whisk the eggs in is completely free from grease, as any traces can prevent the egg whites from whisking. To ensure the bowl is completely clean, wipe it with kitchen paper soaked in a little white wine vinegar before adding the eggs.

Whisk the whites
Add the sugar
Gradually whisk in 85g caster sugar, a tablespoon at a time, until the mixture is thick, glossy, and holds its forms a soft peak on the whisk. Over-whisking can make the mixture dry, leading to cracked macaron shells.

Add the sugar
Combine to a batter
Gently fold the almond and sugar mixture through the meringue mix, one third at a time, with a large metal spoon. The resulting batter should be smooth, uniform and gently flowing. Don't overwork it – if it's too runny, the macarons will spread too thinly once piped. <br>

                <h3>This is the recipe details.</h3>
                Prepare the cauliflower
                Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Half fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil over a medium-high heat. Remove the outer leaves from 1 whole cauliflower, then chop the rest into florets, halving or quartering any large pieces as needed to make them all an even size. The leftover stem and leaves can be chopped up and cooked in stir-fries, so don’t chuck them away!
                
                Prepare the cauliflower
                Cook the cauliflower
                Add the florets to the pan and bring back up to the boil. Cook for 5 mins, or until the cauliflower is just tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, but still firm enough to hold its shape. Drain and set aside.
                
                Cook the cauliflower
                Make the sauce base
                The cheese sauce starts with a roux base. Gently melt 40g butter in a pan over a low heat, then stir in 50g plain flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for just a few seconds until it forms a smooth, thick paste.
                
                Make the sauce base
                Add the milk and cheese
                Measure out 450ml milk. Pour a little into the pan and stir until smooth. Keep adding the milk, a little at a time, stirring until fully combined. Cook gently for another 2 mins, stirring to stop it catching on the bottom. Add 80g mature Cheddar cheese, grated, and 1 tsp English mustard and stir until melted into the sauce. Season and remove from the heat.
                
                Add the milk and cheese
                Transfer to baking dish
                Pour some of the cheese sauce into a deep ovenproof dish. Add the cauliflower, then pour over the rest of the sauce to fully cover. Grate another 50g mature Cheddar over the top, then place on a baking tray to catch any sauce that bubbles over.
                
                Make ahead
                Make the recipe as above to the end of step 5. Cool completely, then cover with clingfilm and keep in the fridge for up to 2 days before cooking. Cook on a baking tray, as above, but adding an extra 8-10 mins to the cooking time to ensure it is fully heated through. <br>

                <h3>This is the recipe details.</h3>
                Prepare the ingredients
Preheat the oven to gas 3, 170ºC, fan 150ºC. Chop 4 carrots, 1 red onion, 2 celery stalks, 1 leek, and 4 slices of pancetta, into large pieces.

Prepare the ingredients
Soften
Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large, ovenproof casserole dish. Add the chopped vegetables and pancetta. Cook over a high heat until the vegetables start to brown and soften. Add 4 peeled cloves of garlic and 2 sprigs of thyme and cook for another 5 minutes.

Soften
Deglaze
Add in 150ml white wine and scrape the bottom of pan. Add the juice of half a lemon and 300ml of hot chicken stock. Bring to the boil and season. Place a large whole chicken on top of the vegetables and season well. 

Deglaze
Bake
Crumple a large piece of nonstick baking paper and dampen it slightly. Place this over the top of the pan so it hangs over the side and top with the lid. This will keep the steam in and the chicken tender. Bake in the oven for 1 hour 45 minutes; 25 minutes before the end of cooking remove the lid and greaseproof paper.

Bake
Serve
Once the chicken is cooked, remove it and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Remove the vegetables, herbs and pancetta and skim any fat off the top of the sauce. Adjust the seasoning and reduce over a high heat if needed. Slice the chicken and serve with the vegetables and the sauce. <br>
